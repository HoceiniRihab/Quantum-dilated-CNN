# Hybrid Quantum dilated convolution neural network 

This is a project for building a **Hybrid Quantum Dilated Convolutional Neural Network (QDCNN)** 
The goal is to investigate the role of quantum entanglement in sequential data processing, with a particular focus on analyzing the impact of entanglement depth. We explore how hybrid quantum circuits combined with classical dilated convolutions enhance the learning of long-term dependencies in sequential data.
