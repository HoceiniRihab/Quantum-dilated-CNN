# Hybrid Quantum dilated convolution neural network 

This is a project for building a **Hybrid Quantum Dilated Convolutional Neural Network (QDCNN)** 
The goal is to explore how combining quantum circuits with classical dilated convolutions can help in learning long-term dependencies in sequential data
